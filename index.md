# The Chicago CTO Forum is closed

It’s been a wonderful 5+ years serving the Chicago technology community. You can find out more about the transition [here](/time-for-a-transition). 
The group you’re probably looking for is the Chicago CTO Group and can be found [here](http://www.chicagoctogroup.com/).

Thank you for all your support and help. Stay tuned for the next chapter in my career.
